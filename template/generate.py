        # ======= RANOMNESS =======
        # Always use self.seed for reproducibility. Different generators can be used
        # but the seed has to be specified and it has to be self.seed. Seeds derived 
        # deterministically from this seed are also fine. Use np.random.seed(self.seed), 
        # or random.seed(self.seed). Doing something like np.random.seed(self.seed + 1) 
        # is also fine if you need to generate different random numbers in different places.  

        # ====== CONFIGURATION =======
        # Use config parameters as you define them in config.json. Avoid hardcoded values
        # in this method if the number might come from generating distributions configured 
        # in the config.json. Use the configuration like this:
        # PARAMETER_1 = self.get_params()['PARAMETER_1']
        # PARAMETER_2 = self.get_params()['PARAMETER_2']

        # ======= TASK GENERATION =======
        # This is the main code used to generate the task.
        # This code needs to:
        # 1) Generate input data and save it to self.input_dir
        # 2) Generate ground truth files and save it to self.ground_truth_dir
        # 3) Populate self.ground_truth dictionary with pandas DataFrames. These dataframes 
        #    can be arbitrary but they should contain all generated numbers, ground_truth and
        #    final answers. These dataframes are used as truth source for generating metarubrics,
        #    and can be used to study exact failure modes of LLMS. File ground_truth.json is 
        #    generated automaticall based on self.ground_truth during the task evaluation stage 
        #    when running evaluate.py.
