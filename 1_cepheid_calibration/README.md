## Problem definition

The provided dataset contains results of a simulated observational campaign aimed at calibrating the period-luminosity relation for Cepheid variables. The relation is assumed to take the form:

$$M = a [\log_{10}(P) - 1] + b.$$

The dataset is a database of observations stored as a PDF table. The data has been partly corrupted, so not all rows contain all data — discard incomplete rows and use only those where a galaxy spectrum, an estimated Cepheid period, and its mean apparent magnitude are all available.

Assume that the redshift of a Cepheid in a galaxy equals the redshift of the whole galaxy due to cosmological expansion. Assume the validity of Hubble's law in the form:

$$v_{\text{rec}} = H_0 \cdot d$$

across the whole provided dataset, with $H_0 = 67\\,\text{km}\\,\text{s}^{-1}\\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Estimate galaxy redshifts using template cross-correlation in log-$\lambda$ space. Since the redshifts are small, assume the classical formula for the redshift. The laboratory reference spectrum is provided together with the dataset.

Produce the following outputs:

1. A PDF table with two columns — one listing Cepheids ordered by their ID and the other showing the estimated redshifts to 5 decimal places.
2. A plot of the data points used for the fit, including the best-fit straight line motivated by the period-luminosity relation.
3. A TXT file clearly stating the estimated fit parameters with uncertainties derived from the linear regression.

## About the data

The dataset simulates an observational campaign targeting hypothetical galaxies. Galaxy 
spectra are generated using tabulated emission lines in the 400–750 nm range, with 
brightness profiles approximated by normal distributions. Spectral lines are Doppler-shifted 
according to each galaxy's redshift, drawn from a uniform distribution. Cepheid periods 
and apparent magnitudes are modelled using Pogson's equation and Hubble's law to produce 
physically realistic values, with Gaussian smearing applied to simulate measurement uncertainty.
